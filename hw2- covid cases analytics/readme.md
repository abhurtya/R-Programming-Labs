The statistical community and several media outlets heavily criticized the plot for its deceptive portrayal of COVID-19 trends in Georgia. Whether the result was malicious intent or poor judgment, it is incredibly irresponsible to publish data visualizations that obscure and distort the truth. 

In this homework, we will "pretend" that we are data scientists tasked with making better COVID-19 visualizations.
