# R-Programming-Labs
Welcome to my R programming class repository! Here you will find all of my tests and assignments for my R programming course. Each folder contains the rmd code file and documentation for each assignment.

## Usage
Feel free to use any of the code in this repository as a reference for your own projects. Please note that these assignments were completed for educational purposes only and may not necessarily represent best practices for real-world data analysis.

## Credits
All code and documentation in this repository was written by me. Special thanks to my instructor Prof. Osei Tweneboah for the guidance and support throughout the course.
